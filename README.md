# Great Learning - Full Stack Developer Assignment (educross-app)

This project is a high-quality, production-ready, cross-platform (Web, iOS, Android) application built to satisfy the "Activity Listing Page" problem statement. It's built from a single TypeScript codebase using React Native and Expo.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Cross-Platform:** A single codebase that runs natively on iOS, Android, and on the Web.
- **Responsive UI:** The UI adapts to all screen sizes, with platform-specific header alignment.
- **Component-Based:** Built with reusable, data-driven components (e.g., `ActivityCard`).
- **Dynamic Filtering:** Users can filter the activity list by program ("All," "AI," "ML," "Cloud").
- **Live Search:** Users can search for activities by title in real-time.
- **Light/Dark Mode:** Full support for system-based and user-toggled light and dark themes.
- **Type-Safe:** Written entirely in TypeScript for production-ready code.
- **Modern UX:**
  - **Skeleton Loaders:** Shows a professional loading state before data appears.
  - **Section Headers:** Groups activities by date ("Today," "Upcoming," "Past Activities") using a `SectionList`.
  - **Polished Empty State:** A clean, icon-based message appears when no activities are found.
- **Unit Tested:** Includes a basic Jest & React Native Testing Library test suite for component validation.

## 🛠 Tech Choices & Tradeoffs

| Technology                 | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **React Native (Expo)**    | The assignment required a single codebase for web and native. Expo is the leading solution for this, providing fast setup, a managed workflow, and a powerful "Expo Go" companion app for live mobile testing.                |
| **React Native Paper**     | The assignment preferred a design library supporting both web and native. React Native Paper is a high-quality, Material Design library that works perfectly on both platforms and has built-in support for light/dark modes. |
| **React Navigation**       | The standard for routing in React Native. We used the Bottom Tab Navigator, which provides a consistent and familiar UI on all platforms.                                                                                     |
| **TypeScript**             | Chosen for code quality, maintainability, and type safety, which is expected in a "production-ready" application.                                                                                                             |
| **Jest & Testing Library** | Added to demonstrate a professional workflow that includes unit testing for component reliability.                                                                                                                            |
| **Local Mock Data**        | Per the problem statement, data is mocked locally (`src/data/mockData.ts`) instead of being fetched from a live API. This allowed for a faster build focused on the frontend requirements.                                    |

## Limitations & Next Steps (v2)

- **Real API:** The data is currently mocked. The next step would be to replace the `MOCK_ACTIVITIES` import with a `useEffect` hook that fetches data from a real backend API.
- **Navigation:** The "Action" buttons on the cards (e.g., "Start," "Review") currently only show an alert. The next step would be to use React Navigation to move the user to a detailed screen for that specific activity.
- **Full Tappable Cards:** A planned enhancement is to make the entire `ActivityCard` pressable, not just the action button, to improve mobile usability.
- **Pull to Refresh:** Adding a "pull to refresh" gesture to the list would be a standard native feature to re-fetch data.
